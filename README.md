# EqualizerCpp
This is my source code for an audio equalizer I created. It contains two parameters - a high pass and a low pass.
The GUI is implemented using the JUCE framework, however all the Digital Signal Processing is done by me using mathematical equations. 
I am currently working on adding a "make-up gain" slider in order to increase the volume that was lost when cutting frequencies.
